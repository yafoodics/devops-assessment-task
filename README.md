# DevOps Engineer Task: Automated Deployment and Container Orchestration

## Objective:
Set up a complete automated deployment pipeline for a containerized web application using Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes on your local machine.

## Task Description:
You are required to set up an automated deployment pipeline for a sample web application. The pipeline will include configuration management with Ansible, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes.

## Requirements:
1. **Local Environment Setup:**
   - Set up a local environment with the following components:
     - A local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using Minikube or Kind)
     - Docker installed on your local machine

2. **Containerization:**
   - Create a Dockerfile for a sample web application (You can use any simple web application, such as a static website or a basic Node.js/Flask application).
   - Build the Docker image and push it to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

3. **Kubernetes Deployment:**
   - Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying the containerized web application to your local Kubernetes cluster.
   - Ensure the application is accessible via a LoadBalancer service.

4. **Continuous Deployment:**
	- Use Ansible to automate the following steps:
	- Build and push the Docker image to a registry on code push.
	- Configure the local environment on changes to the Ansible configuration.
	- Deploy the application on changes to the Kubernetes manifests.

## Deliverables:
1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Create a public GitHub repository and include the following:
     - Ansible playbooks in a directory named `ansible/`
     - Dockerfile and application code in a directory named `app/`
     - Kubernetes manifests in a directory named `k8s/`

2. **Ansible Playbooks:**
   - Provide the Ansible playbooks used to automate the tasks above.
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the Ansible playbooks.

3. **Docker:**
   - Provide the Dockerfile and instructions on how to build and push the Docker image.
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the Docker container locally.

4. **Kubernetes:**
   - Provide the Kubernetes manifests used to deploy the application.
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to apply the Kubernetes manifests and access the application.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Provide a comprehensive document explaining the architecture of the solution, the decisions made, and any challenges faced.
   - Include diagrams where necessary to illustrate the architecture and workflow.
